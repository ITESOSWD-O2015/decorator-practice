## Homework

Tacazones is implementing TuTaco but they want some
changes to be added to the application:
- They also sell “Volcanes” of any meat
- They have different sizes of tacos (mini, regular and mega)
- They also sell Fish and Shrimp tacos (only regular and mega)

## Practice

- Reorganize TuTaco to separate condiments that only alters cost from condiments that only alters size (also draw the corresponding class diagram)
- Make a UI for TuTaco that would take orders and calculate prices.
